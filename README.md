# 📞 Megaline: Tariff Analysis

## 📝 Context
Megaline is a telecommunications operator offering two prepaid plans: **Surf** and **Ultimate**.  
The goal of this project is to analyze the behavior of 500 customers throughout 2018 to determine which of the two tariffs generates higher revenue, thus optimizing commercial and advertising strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python**: Data analysis and statistical modeling.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: Data cleaning and transformation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Visualization of patterns and trends.
- **SciPy**: Hypothesis testing.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Documenting the analysis workflow.

## 📈 Results Analysis
The project was structured in several phases:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning of outliers and missing values.
   - Conversion of measurement units (e.g., minutes and megabytes).
   - Merging of five tables to consolidate customer, call, message, mobile data, and plan information.

2. **Descriptive Analysis**:
   - Calculation of monthly revenue for each customer.
   - Graphical comparison of usage and spending between the Surf and Ultimate plans.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Statistical evaluation to determine whether the differences in revenue between plans and regions are significant.

## 📋 Conclusions
- Proper preprocessing allowed for a robust and reliable analysis.
- Graphs and statistics demonstrated that the **Surf** plan generates higher revenue for the company, primarily because many users exceed the plan's inclusions and must pay additional costs.
- The use of hypothesis testing provided statistical support to validate the observed differences, strengthening the commercial recommendation.
- The analysis highlights the importance of making data-driven decisions to optimize service offerings and allocate marketing budgets more effectively.
